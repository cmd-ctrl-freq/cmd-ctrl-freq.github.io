If you want to know about my career history, you can check out my LinkedIn, so I'm going to try to make this a little more personal.

I'm really passionate about cybersecurity, but also privacy, consumer rights, and technology in general. It was actually quite a personal dilemma; deciding whether or not to publish a public portfolio. I've got a ton of personal projects that I think are quite interesting, and I'm planning to continue giving talks in the future, but I also see all of this information about myself, if it is to be public, as an attack surface. I suppose that once you start seeing things from an adversarial perspective, it's quite hard to turn that mindset off. For the moment, I have concluded that the attack surface is worth whatever social and career benifits a public blog might bring. 

I love cybersecurity because it's a career field that allows me to solve really interesting problems while actually making the world better by securing the digital systems that run an ever increasing percentage of our world. I'm familiar with Wifi, AWS, Web Application, API, and some Network pentesting. I'm interested in self-hosting services to avoid my being exploited by whatever myraid array of companies are willing to sell me convenience at the cost of my privacy, and utimately my dignity.

I think that technology should empower the individual and not just exploit them, so I hope to include projects in the future that achieve that outcome.
